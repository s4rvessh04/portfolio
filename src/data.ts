export const professionalSummary = `
I am a performance-driven Software Engineer focused on building robust backend systems that power enterprise products. Over the last two years, I've specialized in managing microservices and scaling infrastructure—consistently delivering measurable improvements in system efficiency and code reliability.
I am a strong advocate for Generative AI in software engineering, utilizing it to ship faster and elevate code quality. I thrive on "leveling up" technical stacks and pushing the boundaries of what a system can handle. When I'm not at my desk, I'm usually traveling or finding fresh inspiration at EDM events, bringing that same high energy back to the codebase.
