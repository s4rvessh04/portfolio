export const professionalSummary = `
Software Engineer with 2+ years of hands-on experience building and scaling backend systems for real-world, enterprise-level products. 
I’ve worked across a small fleet of microservices, boosted overall throughput by 40%, 
and helped cut critical production bugs by 50% after launch. 
I love building clean, scalable services and 
I actively use Generative AI to speed up development, improve code quality, and debug smarter.
Always looking to push performance, ship faster, and level up the tech wherever I go.
Apart from coding, I enjoy traveling, attending events, and listening to
EDM music to stay inspired and motivated.
